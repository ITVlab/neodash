NeoDash is a new modular screensaver app designed for Android TV. It makes the best use of screen real-estate by showing lots of useful information.

The app is based on [Muzei](https://github.com/romannurik/muzei) and [DashClock](https://github.com/romannurik/dashclock), and uses both of those platforms to give users immediate access to ample numbers of extensions. NeoDash combines both services in a way that minimizes the impact of those codebases and maximizes the user experience on televisions.

New artwork gives users a notification with `PRIORITY_MAX`, often being the first notification on your TV. When you press home, this effectively changes your background to be whichever image you want.
